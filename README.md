## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Vue](https://v3.vuejs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This is my first frontendmentor project and my first project built with Vue. I'm aiming to learn Vue and this project was great for improving my skills as well as build out the project without having figma design to lookup. So it was challenging and it took me a while to understand how much spacing and size i needed to use to complete this task.
